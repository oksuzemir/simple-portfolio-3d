      <h2>📜 Manifesto</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, I am Emir Öksüz and I am 21 years old. I have been working in the software
        industry for 3 years. During my first professional year, I did web designs and
        coding for businesses as a freelancer. After that, I’ve been working as a full
        stack developer in web and mobile applications, and I continue to specialize in
        this field, especially in appointment dashboards and web apps.
